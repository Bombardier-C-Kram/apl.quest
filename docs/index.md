This site allows you to exercise your [APL](https://apl.wiki) skills using the practice problems from the [APL Problem Solving Competition](https://www.dyalog.com/student-competition.htm#APLPSComp)'s phase 1.

The problems are designed to be solved using a short [dfn](https://aplwiki.com/wiki/Dfn) or [tacit function](https://aplwiki.com/wiki/Tacit_programming). If you find yourself writing more than a couple of statements in your solution, you can probably find a better way to do it. You can use [TryAPL](https://tryapl.org) to experiment and develop your solution.

Every problem has one or more solutions explained fully in the [APL Quest video series](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLYKQVqyrAEj9wDIUyLDGtDAFTKY38BUMN). These solutions come from live events that happened in the [APL Orchard chat room](https://apl.chat) on Stack Exchange. You will find the relevant walk-through video at the bottom of each problem page, together with links to the chat transcript and solution code on GitHub.
