This site allows you to exercise your [APL](https://apl.wiki) skills using the practice problems from the [APL Problem Solving Competition](https://www.dyalog.com/student-competition.htm#APLPSComp)'s phase 1.

Each problem starts with a task description and some also include a hint suggesting one or more APL primitives. These may be helpful in solving the problem, but you are under no obligation to use them. Clicking on a primitive in the hint opens the Dyalog documentation page for that primitive.

Each problem ends with some example cases. You can use these as a basis for implementing your solution.

Notice something wrong? [Report a bug](https://github.com/Dyalog/apl.quest/issues/new?assignees=&labels=&template=bug_report.md&title=).

Every problem has one or more solutions explained fully in the [APL Quest video series](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLYKQVqyrAEj9wDIUyLDGtDAFTKY38BUMN). You will find the relevant walk-through video at the bottom of each problem page, together with links to the chat transcript and solution code on GitHub.
